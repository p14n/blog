I'm increasingly convinced that the ideal tool for developers and architects to use for written documentation, and even communication, is markdown, stored in git.

#### What's wrong with sharepoint/confluence...?
Every documentation repository I've worked with has had the same problems:
* docs are scattered
* docs are outdated
* search is unreliable or returns many inauthorative results
* the history and context of the document is missing
&nbsp;  

#### Why?
* If our docs are not tied to the thing they are describing, they become outdated 
* Our code is reusable, our docs are not (reorganising is a big job, and from the moment it's done, entropy sets in again)
* We're using publishing tools as a single source of truth for our information, but it's then locked in that platform, and difficult to move elsewhere

#### What should we be doing?
* Writing docs in a simple format that's easy to edit, and easy to parse (by humans and machines) - markdown
* Storing docs in a git repo, which has great support for multi-user editing
* Publishing this information where it's needed, using our existing CI tools

#### Examples
* Architectural decision [records](https://adr.github.io/)
* Guides with [Docausauras](https://docusaurus.io/)
* Presentations with [Reveal-md](https://github.com/webpro/reveal-md)
* Markdown with components using [MDX](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx)
* Diagrams with [Mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/)
* Collaborative, embeddable diagrams with [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/)
* Document metadata (think tags, authors, progress indicators) with [Frontmatter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/)
* This blog - written in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), stored in [Github](https://github.com/), published to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/)
