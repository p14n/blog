I've spent my working life doing things I love:
* architecture in various technologies and platforms
* writing in various programming languages
* getting code to production; faster, with fewer bugs
* helping teams do all of the above

I firmly believe: 
* code without tests is a prototype or a mistake 
* the best documentation is living 
* deployment should be single click (by a stakeholder) or less 
* configuration is code 
* observability of a running system is crucial to its operation
